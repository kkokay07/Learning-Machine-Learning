        "## What is Regression?\n",
        "\n",
        "Regression analysis is a statistical method used to model and analyze the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features/predictors). It helps us understand how changes in independent variables influence the dependent variable, enabling prediction and inference.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Core Concept\n",
        "At its heart, regression attempts to find the best-fitting mathematical relationship between variables by minimizing the difference between predicted and actual values.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Historical Context\n",
        "The term \"regression\" was coined by Francis Galton in the 19th century during his study of human heights, where he observed that children of tall parents tend to be shorter than their parents (regressing toward the mean).\n",

        "## Why Do We Use Regression?\n",
        "\n",
